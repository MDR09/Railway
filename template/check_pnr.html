    <h3>What is PNR?</h3>
    <p>PNR is short for 'Passenger Name Record'. It is a record in the database of Indian Railways against 
        which the journey details for a passenger, or a group of passengers are stored. Centre for
         Railway Information Systems (CRIS) also maintains information like current PNR status of the 
         passengers, availability of berths in all classes for the next 60 days and static enquiries like 
         Train Between Important Stations, Reservations Rules, Fares, Refund, and Rules etc.</p>
    <p>When a reserved railway ticket is booked for a train in Indian Railways, all the details of passengers are
         stored in relational database of centralized reservation system. These details are associated with a 
         unique ten-digit number. This reference number is called PNR. PNR number is generally printed at the 
         top left corner of the printed tickets. In case of the E-Ticket, it is mentioned at top in separate
          cell. Passenger's personal information like name, age, gender etc. is saved in the database against
           this reference number. It includes columns to store booking status and current status of the ticket. 
           As we know every train has limited number of seats, sometime one may not get a confirmed reserved 
           ticket. The current status of such a waitlist (W/L) ticket changes when there is any availability 
           of reserved seats due to cancellation. This new current reservation status is generally known as PNR 
           status.</p>

    <h3>PNR Status Confirmation of different waitlist tickets</h3>
    <p>GNWL (General Waiting List) - Highest confirmation chances</p>
    <p>CKWL (Tatkal Waiting List) - GNWL tickets are preferred over Tatkal tickets hence CKWL Confirmation chances are low compared to GNWL</p>
    <p>RLWL (Remote Location Waiting List) - Less chances of confirmation</p>
    <p>PQWL (Pooled Quota Waiting List) - Less chances of confirmation, quota shared between several stations</p>
    <p>RLGN (Remote Location General Waiting List) - Less chances of confirmation, when user books ticket under RLWL</p>
    <p>RQWL (Request Waiting List) - Less chances of confirmation</p>
    <p>RSWL (Roadside Station Waiting List) - Less chances of confirmation</p>

        PNR is an abbreviation for 'Passenger Name Record'. As the term suggests, when you book a ticket, an entry 
        is created in your name and a 10-digit unique id is allotted against your transaction. This is your ‘PNR 
        number’. This id is the key to figure a variety of information about your train reservation. For instance, 
        PNR status tells you if booking is confirmed or you’ll need to wait to get a seat if someone cancels their 
        ticket. Apart from booking confirmation, you also get to know the details of the train coach and berth, the
        fare paid by you, and the departure and arrival date and timelines. What’s more, you can check the PNR 
        status using your smartphone too. Below explains how you could do the same. Using PNR Number to check
